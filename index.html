	Rising food and fuel prices contributed to a sharp fall in Britain’s retail sales in January, indicating that higher prices are beginning to bite.

Seasonally adjusted volumes, excluding fuel, were 0.2 per cent lower in January than in December, the Office for National Statistics reported on Friday. This was significantly weaker than analysts had predicted and defied expectations that the drop recorded in December was a one-off. The consensus forecast had been for a 0.7 per cent increase.

Sales in January were 1.5 per cent higher than the same month a year ago, the weakest annual growth since November 2013.

“In the three months to January 2017, retail sales saw the first signs of a fall in the underlying trend since December 2013,” said Kate Davies, ONS senior statistician.

“We have seen falls in month-on-month seasonally adjusted retail sales, both in conventional stores and online, and the evidence suggests that increased prices in fuel and food are significant factors in this slowdown.”

Both online and in store sales were lower in January than in December. At stores that sell predominantly food, sales volumes were 0.2 per cent lower in January 2017 than in January 2016. This is the first annual fall since April 2015 and coincided with a rise in store prices.

The drop in January’s sales added to the sharp fall already recorded in December.

“The failure of retail sales in January to rise at all after December’s 2.1 per cent month-to-month drop demonstrates that consumers’ spending has shifted down several gears in response to slowing employment growth and rising inflation,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.

The ONS figures corroborate recent surveys from the CBI, the employers’ group, and the British Retail Consortium, which had suggested a further drop in retail sales in January.

Retailers are expected to increase prices further this year as the currency hedging they had in place before the referendum comes to an end and they try to pass the higher costs resulting from sterling’s devaluation on to
